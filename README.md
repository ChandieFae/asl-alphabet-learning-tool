# ASL Alphabet Learning Tool âœ‹

This is a free and open ASL (American Sign Language) learning tool designed to make the ASL alphabet accessible to anyone â€” especially after a local college course was discontinued due to low enrollment.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists

When classes fade, knowledge shouldnâ€™t. This tool was built to help people continue learning ASL on their own â€” visually, interactively, and with purpose.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Interactive ASL alphabet grid (Aâ€“Z)
- Real ASL hand signs
- Click to view a description and visual
- Mobile-friendly and printable chart included
